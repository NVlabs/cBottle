### Signing Your Work

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on each of their commits. This
certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to
submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
By doing this you are agreeing to the full DCO:
